Objective: The goal of this project was to automate the process of sending birthday wishes via WhatsApp, ensuring timely and personalized messages without manual intervention.
Technologies Used: The project used Python for scripting, Selenium for web automation, and pywhatkit for sending WhatsApp messages. I used Pandas to retrieve data from a CSV file that contains the name, phone number, and birthday date of contacts.
import pywhatkit
import pandas
from datetime import datetime

df=pandas.read_csv('birthday.csv')
today= datetime.now().strftime('%d-%m')

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row['Birthday']==today:
        name=row['Name']
        phone=row['Phone']
        message=f"Happy Birthday {name}...."
        pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg(f"+{phone}",message,9,5)
